# Generative Art 
I have recreated two paintings, 'Valori Plasiti' and 'Giocoforza n. 15', by Italian Futurist artist, Giacomo Balla. 
## General Information
Taking on this artistic challenge, I aimed to explore how code can be used as a creative tool capable of recreating the energy and movement of Balla's work through complex geometrical shapes and curves.

* Python Mode for Processing 4 
## Launch 
1. Install Processing 4
2. Enable Python Mode
